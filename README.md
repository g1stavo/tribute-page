Why?
=============

This is my resolution for the first freeCodeCamp frontend project, Build a Tribute Page.The idea was to build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/NNvBQW/). I chose to build a George Harrison tribute page, because he's a great musician from a band that i like, The Beatles.
